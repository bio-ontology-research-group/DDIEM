These findings are somewhat contradictory to what has been proposed for the AGU-Fin mutated AGA, which has been suggested to become rapidly degraded after synthesis in the ER19,28. However, these previous studies have been based on overexpression of the mutated enzyme mainly in chinese hamster ovarian cells, which may result in ER overload and unfolded protein response, facilitating the degradation of the AGU-Fin mutant precursors. We here show that endogenous T122K and AGU-Fin AGA in patient fibroblasts do not colocalize with the ER marker calnexin, whereas a high degree of colocalization was observed with lysosomal markers. However, it is likely that the misfolding induced by T122K mutation is milder than that of AGU-Fin which impairs the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond20.

Patients are treated with a diet high in protein with complex, low glycemic index carbohydrates. Since gluconeogenesis is intact, protein supplementation provides gluconeogenic precursors that can be used for endogenous glucose production. In turn, there is also less dependence upon fatty acid oxidation, and accumulation of free fatty acids and ketones is prevented. This not only reduces systemic acidosis, but prevention of hyperketonemia also enhances gluconeogenesis since more alanine can be released from skeletal muscle. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/106027

These drugs, in fact, should be used with caution in patients with Dubin-Johnson syndrome. Reporting on a patient with the disease who had a novel 974C→G nonsense mutation of the MRP2gene, Corpechot et al found a rise in conjugated bilirubinemia following the chronic administration of rifampicin, as well as a sharp increase in serum bile acid concentration following the concomitant chronic administration of rifampicin and UDCA. These adverse effects may result from an increased expression of MRP3at the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes as a direct consequence of drug induction.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16952291 https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/173517-treatment",rifampicin+UDCA,DB01045+DB01586,,,,,,,,,,High biliary cholesterol saturation index,,NA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16952291/,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16083704/,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26264947,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12012642,,,,,,,
