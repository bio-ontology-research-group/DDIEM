Patients are treated with a diet high in protein with complex, low glycemic index carbohydrates. Since gluconeogenesis is intact, protein supplementation provides gluconeogenic precursors that can be used for endogenous glucose production. In turn, there is also less dependence upon fatty acid oxidation, and accumulation of free fatty acids and ketones is prevented. This not only reduces systemic acidosis, but prevention of hyperketonemia also enhances gluconeogenesis since more alanine can be released from skeletal muscle. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/106027

In contrast, intranasally administered GNeo-IDUA entered the brain rapidly. Repetitive intranasal treatment with GNeo-IDUA reduced glycosaminoglycan storage, lysosome size and number, and neurodegenerative astrogliosis in the olfactory bulb and primary somatosensory cortex, whereas IDUA was less effective. The enhanced efficacy of GNeo-IDUA was not the result of increased nose-to-brain delivery or enzyme stability, but rather due to more efficient uptake into neurons and astrocytes. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28958576",NA,,,,,,,,,,,ECO:0005542,ECO:0005542,,,Direct interaction (A),A,neurodegenerative astrogliosis,HP:0002180*,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28958576,

Drug name:  Tetrahydrobiopterin stimulates phenylalanine hydroxylase activity in about 20% of patients, and in those patients serves as a useful adjunct to the phenylalanine-restricted diet because it increases phenylalanine tolerance and allows some dietary freedom.. A striking normalisation (within 8 h) in phenylalanine concentrations after drug administartion indicates BH4 deficiency whereas very little or no reduction in phenylalanine indicates BH4-non-responsive phenylketonuria. https:"",www.sciencedirect.com,science,article,pii,""S0140673610609610?via%3Dihub
Mutation that didn't get benefits out the treatment: Homozygotes of R252W, IVS4-1G→A, and R413P presented with clinical symptoms typical of classical PKU. Therefore these mutations appear to abolish PAH function. https:"",www.sciencedirect.com,science,article,pii,""S0022347699701381?via%3Dihub
Mutation improved by treatment: The serum Phe concentrations of patients have those mutaions never exceeded 20 mg"",""dL, even when they were not on a Phe-restricted diet, suggesting that mutant PAH molecules with P407S, A373T, and R241C have residual enzymatic activities. https:"",www.sciencedirect.com,science,article,pii,S0022347699701381?via%3Dihubhttps:,www.sciencedirect.com,science,article,pii,S0022347699701381?via%3Dihub",B,Low levels of serum vitamin B12,,,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24424200,https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/3024/intrinsic-factor-deficiency#",
