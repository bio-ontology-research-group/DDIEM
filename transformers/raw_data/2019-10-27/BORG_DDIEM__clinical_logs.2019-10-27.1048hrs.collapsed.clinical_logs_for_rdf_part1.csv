Patients are treated with a diet high in protein with complex, low glycemic index carbohydrates. Since gluconeogenesis is intact, protein supplementation provides gluconeogenic precursors that can be used for endogenous glucose production. In turn, there is also less dependence upon fatty acid oxidation, and accumulation of free fatty acids and ketones is prevented. This not only reduces systemic acidosis, but prevention of hyperketonemia also enhances gluconeogenesis since more alanine can be released from skeletal muscle. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/106027

Clinical exacerbation in Glut 1 DS could happen with certain AEDs based on their mechanism of action or effects on the Glut 1 transporter. Common AEDs known to inhibit the Glut 1 transporter in vitro, for example, 1) phenobarbital https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12029447?dopt=Abstract , 2) Valporate https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16149077?dopt=Abstract 3) Benzodiazepines https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12029447?dopt=Abstract are relatively contraindicated in Glut 1 DS. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22812641/
In addition, combination therapy of KD and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors—for example, topiramate, zonisamide, and acetazolamide—may increase risk of non–anion gap metabolic acidosis and urolithiasis, and should be avoided if possible https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20466520?dopt=Abstract",SLC2A1,SLC2A1,glucose transporter protein type 1 (GLUT1),0e7de367e413ba6ca566939d489e659213b581b1ca05cb9c934d9859a8fe26a3,6.3.1.2,6.3.1.2,,,UX007 (triheptanoin),DB11677,DB11677,115f88e792ac4c1f77dd94eaa4397c6786548cf7579b5261b32e39aba75c2e5d,DB11677,DB11677,,,,,,,ECO:0007121/ECO:0005542,"ECO:0007121,ECO:0005542",,,Symptomatic (C),C,seizures,HP:0001250,,"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01993186?cond=Glucose+transporter+type+1+deficiency+syndrome&rank=1,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02960217?cond=Glucose+transporter+type+1+deficiency+syndrome&rank=2,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02036853?cond=Glucose+transporter+type+1+deficiency+syndrome&rank=3,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02000960?cond=Glucose+transporter+type+1+deficiency+syndrome&rank=5,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29303961,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02014883?cond=Glucose+transporter+type+1+deficiency+syndrome&rank=9,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23196212/",6513,SLC2A1,480,

However, neither an indication nor a general role for these agents in Dubin-Johnson syndrome has been defined.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12012642
These drugs, in fact, should be used with caution in patients with Dubin-Johnson syndrome. Reporting on a patient with the disease who had a novel 974C→G nonsense mutation of the MRP2gene, Corpechot et al found a rise in conjugated bilirubinemia following the chronic administration of rifampicin, as well as a sharp increase in serum bile acid concentration following the concomitant chronic administration of rifampicin and UDCA. These adverse effects may result from an increased expression of MRP3at the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes as a direct consequence of drug induction.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16952291 https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/173517-treatment",rifampicin+UDCA,DB01045+DB01586,DB01045 + DB01586,89b0c42ca78054fd1efde035da5c346f43caa1e22700dfa40843160f4633457a,,,,,"DB01045,DB01586","DB01045,DB01586",,,,,,,Symptomatic (C),C,pruritus,HP:0000989,,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16952291/,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16083704/,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26264947,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12012642",1244,ABCC2,554,

Repetitive intranasal treatment with GNeo-IDUA reduced glycosaminoglycan storage, lysosome size and number, and neurodegenerative astrogliosis in the olfactory bulb and primary somatosensory cortex, whereas IDUA was less effective. The enhanced efficacy of GNeo-IDUA was not the result of increased nose-to-brain delivery or enzyme stability, but rather due to more efficient uptake into neurons and astrocytes. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28958576",GNeo-IDUA,NA,,,,,,,,,,,ECO:0005542,ECO:0005542,,,Direct interaction (A),A,neurodegenerative astrogliosis,HP:0002180*,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28958576,3425,IDUA,241,

Cyanocobalamin, a pharmacologic preparation requiring conversion to metabolically active cobalamins, is the form commonly available in the United States, whereas hydroxocobalamin, which requires less frequent injections,1,15 is preferred in parts of Europe. Methylcobalamin, a light-sensitive form, is rarely used.

These include antibiotics like tetracycline and chloramphenicol; antiepileptics like valproate, phenytoin, antiretroviral agents and metformin. Overall their effects in patients with MIDD are not known. Statin therapy should be avoided in patients especially with myopathy.
