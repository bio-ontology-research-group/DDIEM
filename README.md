# DDIEM - Drug database for inborn error of metabolism

Welcome to **DDIEM**, Drug database for inborn errors of metabolism. **DDIEM** database is a database on therapeutic strategies for inborn errors of metabolism. These strategies are classified by mechanism and outcome in [DDIEM Ontology](http://aber-owl.net/ontology/DDIEM/). **DDIEM** uses this ontology to structure the experimental treatments that have been proposed or applied. It includes description of phenotypes addressed by the treatment, drugs participated in treatment and procedures.

Please visit our [Website](ddiem.phenomebrowser.net) to browse the database. It provides a search for metabolic diseases by disease name, drugs used for a treatment and mode of action used in treating the disease. It also provides a SPARQL query editor for query DDIEM data.

DDIEM is jointly developed by researchers from [KAUST BORG](https://borg.kaust.edu.sa) and [University of Cambridge](https://www.pdn.cam.ac.uk/directory/paul-schofield)
