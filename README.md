# DDIEM - Drug database for inborn error of metabolism

Welcome to **DDIEM**, Drug database for inborn errors of metabolism. **DDIEM** database is a database on therapeutic strategies for inborn errors of metabolism. These strategies are classified by mechanism and outcome in [DDIEM Ontology](http://aber-owl.net/ontology/DDIEM/). **DDIEM** uses this ontology to categprise the experimental treatments that have been proposed or applied. It includes descriptions of the phenotypes addressed by the treatment and drugs participating in treatment and procedures.

DDIEM is jointly developed by researchers from [KAUST BORG](https://borg.kaust.edu.sa) and [University of Cambridge](https://www.pdn.cam.ac.uk/directory/paul-schofield)

## Website
Please visit  [DDIEM website](ddiem.phenomebrowser.net) to browse the database. It provides a search for metabolic diseases by disease name, drugs used for a treatment and mode of action used in treating the disease. It also provides a SPARQL query editor for query DDIEM data.
